# Getting Started
Requires Node >= 8.0.0

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

Start the server by running `npm start`

Build static assets by running `npm run build`

Tooling is still a work-in-progress, so server and building static assets will require two separate terminals.


# Running Application

Running followed commands in separate terminals
./runmongo.sh
./startserver.sh
